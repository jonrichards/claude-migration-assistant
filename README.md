# Claude Migration Assistant

A browser-based tool for migrating your Claude data from one account to another (e.g., Team to Enterprise, or personal to work). Processes everything client-side -- no data leaves your machine.

## What It Does

When you switch Claude accounts, you lose your conversation history, memory, projects, and artifacts. This tool helps you:

1. **Process your data export** -- Parses the native Claude export (ZIP or admin JSON), extracts conversations, artifacts, and generates migration documents
2. **Capture memory** -- Guides you through exporting Claude's memory of you from the old account
3. **Recreate projects** -- Helps transfer project custom instructions and knowledge documents
4. **Validate the migration** -- Provides prompts to verify everything transferred correctly

## Two Export Modes

### Personal Export
For individual users. Go to Claude Settings > Privacy > Export Data, download the ZIP, and drop it into the tool.

### Admin Team Export
For team admins closing an account. The admin export produces a folder of JSON files (`conversations.json`, `users.json`, `memories.json`, `projects.json`) covering all team members. The tool lets you:
- Upload all JSON files at once
- Pick a specific team member from a user list
- Auto-populate their memory and projects from the admin data (skipping the manual prompt steps)

## Getting Started

No build step, no dependencies to install. Just serve the files:

```bash
# Python
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Node
npx serve .

# Or any static file server
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

## How It Works

The app walks you through 10 steps in two tracks:

**Track A (Automated)** -- processes the export file client-side:
- A1: Choose export type and run the data export
- A2: Upload and process the export (ZIP or admin JSON files)
- A3: Review the auto-generated context document
- A4: Review and mark important artifacts

**Track B (Manual)** -- guides you through prompt-based migration:
- B1: Capture Claude's memory from the old account
- B2: Capture project blueprints from the old account
- B3: Restore memory in the new account
- B4: Recreate projects in the new account
- B5: Upload critical artifacts
- B6: Validate the migration

In admin mode, steps B1 and B2 are auto-populated from the export data.

## What Transfers

| Data | Fidelity | Method |
|---|---|---|
| Conversation text | Exact copy (read-only archive) | Parsed from export JSON |
| Artifact source code | Exact copy (as files) | Extracted from message content |
| Memory (synthesized) | Approximate | Prompt-based capture, or auto from admin export |
| Project structure | Approximate | Manual recreation with guided prompts |
| Knowledge files | Exact if you have originals | Re-upload to new projects |

## Architecture

Static single-page app with no server component:

```
index.html              # Shell with CDN deps (JSZip, Marked, Lucide, FileSaver, DOMPurify)
css/
  variables.css         # Design tokens
  layout.css            # App shell layout
  components.css        # UI component styles
js/
  app.js                # Entry point, session management
  state.js              # Reactive state with localStorage persistence
  utils.js              # Shared utilities
  data/
    step-definitions.js # Step metadata
    prompts.js          # Copy-paste prompts for manual steps
  processing/
    zip-reader.js       # Reads personal export ZIPs (JSZip)
    admin-reader.js     # Reads admin export JSON files
    conversation-parser.js
    artifact-extractor.js
    context-generator.js
    memory-generator.js
    markdown-formatter.js
    zip-writer.js       # Builds migration package ZIP
  ui/
    sidebar.js          # Step navigation
    step-renderer.js    # Dynamic step loading
    components/         # Reusable UI components
    steps/              # One module per step (step-a1.js .. step-b6.js)
```

## Privacy & Security

All processing happens in your browser. The app:
- Does not make any network requests (beyond loading CDN libraries on page load)
- Does not send your data anywhere -- enforced by a `connect-src 'none'` Content Security Policy
- Stores only step completion state in localStorage (not conversation data)
- Can export/import session progress as a local JSON file
- All CDN scripts are pinned to exact versions with Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes
- HTML from user data is sanitized with DOMPurify before rendering

## Testing

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
npx playwright test
```
